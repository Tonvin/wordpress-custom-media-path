# WordPress custom media path

## Introduction：
The plugin designed to optimize media management by restructuring the default directory organization. By default, WordPress arranges media files based on the year and month of upload, which can lead to performance bottlenecks when handling a large volume of files within a single month.

With this plugin installed, media files are automatically organized into daily directories, resulting in a hierarchical structure of year/month/day. This granular arrangement enhances file retrieval and listing efficiency, mitigating potential slowdowns associated with managing extensive media libraries.

Furthermore, the plugin implements a filename modification feature, ensuring that filenames consist solely of alphanumeric characters. This optimization enhances file system compatibility and facilitates smoother data handling processes within the WordPress environment.
